## Solution to Foundations of Programming questions

It is just an effort to understand and solve questions. I have created folders for every question containing their corresponding solutions.

question_1 - [Find longest word in dictionary that is a subsequence of a given string](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/find-longest-word-in-dictionary-that-subsequence-of-given-string/)

question_2 - [withoutString problem](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/withoutstring-problem-strings-base-remove-return/)

question_3 - [sumNumbers problem](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/subnumbers-problem-string-return-sum)
